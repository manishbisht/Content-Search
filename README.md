## Tagline
Amazon Alexa Skill Set that will help you to get info about any topic or tell details about famous persons.

## Inspiration
I am a student that uses wikipedia to get more about any topic and person. Now to save my time on just checking website, I have given this task to Alexa. So doesn't it looks quite cool that now I can ask Alexa about any topic or details about famous persons and she will tell me the details.

Also the [Amazon Alexa Skills Challenge on Mindsumo](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/hack-your-world) have **$1,600 in prizes plus free amazon dot** what more I need as an Inspiration :)

## What it does
This is a Amazon Alexa Skill Kit will help you to get info about any topic or tell details about famous persons. You can ask questions like Tell me something about water, tell me something about google or who is Mark Zuckerberg.

## How I built it
I have build one amazon alexa skill before. So it was easy for me to build the skill in less time. I have also used the [Amazon Alexa documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit). I have used python 2.7 to build this skill and the backend is hosted on AWS Lamda. I have also used Wikipedia API to get the required content from the wiki pages.

## Challenges I ran into
I have faced many issues while building this entire project.
1. I have learnt how to use Amazon AWS to host the Amazon Skills Kit backend.
2. I have learnt about making http requests in python.
3. I have changed the maximum execution time to 10 seconds so that the content is retrived properly. But I have to improve it more so that it becomes more responsive.

While there are other issues also but with awesome Amazon Alexa and Amazon AWS documentation these problems can be easily solved bu anyone.
 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finally now Alexa can tell me the details about any topic or tell details about famous persons. So no need to use any website. Just Ask Alexa :)
